# Hi, I’m Saba Arif

I am a data analyst with a strong foundation in Python and applied data science, focused on transforming raw data into meaningful insights through structured analysis, statistical exploration, and machine learning. My work spans exploratory data analysis, time-series modeling, and anomaly detection on real-world datasets, with particular interest in understanding and monitoring complex, data-intensive systems.

I am preparing for advanced, research-oriented graduate programs in data science and analytics, with a growing interest in data-driven systems monitoring and applied machine learning for complex domains.
